# Javascript API sticky notes

## Description

I made a password-protected note taking app.

A website with 2 pages that display their contents in the same HTML file.
With each page change the history Web API is used to push a new state and change the URL
The right page is shown according to the URL the user enters in the address bar.
The website store's sticky notes in the localStorage and then retrieve them in the next visit.
